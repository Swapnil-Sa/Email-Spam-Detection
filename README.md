## DESCRIPTION
One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata

â€¢ The project code is completely developed using Python.

â€¢ Dataset is taken from a publicly available YouTube tutorial. It contains labeled SMS messages classified as 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam).

â€¢ Required packages installed: pandas, re, nltk, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, tqdm, time

â€¢ Data Preprocessing, NLP operations, Model Training, and Evaluation are the main steps carried out.

â€¢ Logistic Regression is used as the classification model to achieve high accuracy on the text data processed through NLP.

â€¢ Finally, a classification report is generated to summarize model accuracy.

## Other Key Steps to Spam Mail Detection:

â€¢ **Email Filtering:** One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorizing incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms are trained to filter out spam based on email content and metadata.

â€¢ **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP enables machines to understand and process human language. It is vital in spam detection as it helps extract meaningful features from emails such as subject lines, body text, and attachments.

â€¢ **Label Encoding**: Spam and ham (non-spam) labels are converted into binary numeric values to be used by the machine learning model.

â€¢ **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

â€¢ **Sample Predictions**: Custom email texts are tested on the trained model to verify if the predictions match expected outputs.
